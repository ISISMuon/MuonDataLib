Introduction To Tutorials
=========================

All of the tutorials are Jupyter notebooks that can be downloaded and used locally. However, they are all included as part of this documentation along with their respective outputs.

NOTICE
======

Note that the histogram files generated can only be read by WiMDA v.1.320 on IDAaaS -- do not use the 'latest stable' version.
